### FilmQuery Project
	FilmQuery Project was designed as an java application that interfaces with a database to perform 
	specific queries.  
##	Project Description
	FilmQuery utilizes an SQL database that contains tables that pertain to movies, actors, and related elements.
	The user is given options to search for a film by film_id or keyword.  The results, if present in the database, 
	will be displayed to the user.  
	
## Technology
	Technologies used during design and programming include:
	SQL, MAMP, Eclipse IDE, Atom, JavaSE-1.8, Slack, Zoom,
	Terminal, and the good old internet!
##	Lessons Learned
	This project was challenging.  In retrospect, I wish that I would have stepped away from my computer
	more, when I was presented with an obstacle.
